Human Activity Recognition (HAR) can solve a lot of problems
for example it can be used to monitor elderly people in a better way and
even in security purposes or to track movements in rooms. To perform
Human Activity Recognition data in is collected in form of a point cloud
using a (mmWave) millimeter wave radar. The problem we want to solve
is that how can we do it effectively and accurately (accuracy , data , speed
) which is feasible for most use cases. In this paper first of all all methods
for signal pre processing and Machine Learning (ML) were considered and
then compared to shortlist the most important and effective ones and try to
implement and test them. Our results are based on the accuracy achieved by
the ML methods. We propose a new signal pre processing method which is
a combination of frame divider , dbscan , rotations , enhanced voxelization
and voxelization.
